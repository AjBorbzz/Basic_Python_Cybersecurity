### Project Outline

1. **Define Data Sources**:
   - Identify and select various threat intelligence feeds.
   - Common sources include APIs from AlienVault OTX, VirusTotal, IBM X-Force, and others.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Write functions to fetch data from each source.
   - Normalize the data into a common format.

3. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Combine data from all sources.
   - Remove duplicates and sort the information.

4. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Implement a mechanism to periodically fetch updates.
   - Use a scheduling library like `schedule` or `APScheduler`.

5. **Presentation**:
   - Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) to display the aggregated data.
   - Optionally, create a web interface using a framework like Flask.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Provide a brief explanation of the system.


### Explanation

- **Data Sources**: The script defines a dictionary `FEEDS` with the names and URLs of threat intelligence feeds. You can add more feeds as needed.
- **Data Collection**: The `fetch_feed` function fetches data from a given URL and returns the response in JSON format.
- **Data Aggregation**: The `aggregate_feeds` function iterates over all feeds, fetches data, and aggregates it into a list.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The script uses the `schedule` library to run the `job` function every hour. This function fetches and displays the aggregated data.
- **Presentation**: The `display_aggregated_data` function prints the aggregated data to the console. For a real-world application, you might want to store this data in a database or display it on a web interface.

### Next Steps

- **Normalization**: Normalize the data from different feeds into a common format.
- **Deduplication**: Implement logic to remove duplicate entries.
- **Web Interface**: Optionally, create a web interface using Flask to display the data.
- **Security**: Ensure that the script handles API keys securely and follows best practices for secure coding.

This proof of concept showcases our capability to aggregate threat intelligence feeds and provide real-time updates on the latest threats and vulnerabilities. Let me know if you have any specific requirements or additional features in mind!
